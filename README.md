# odin-recipes

This site is one of the first projects I've created while going through The Odin Project. I have thoroughly enjoyed it, and am continually adding different functionalities to this site as I learn more code.

Right now it's not super great. But my hope is that after I get some more knowledge, this will be one of the sexiest basic recipe sites out there.

Thanks and have fun.
